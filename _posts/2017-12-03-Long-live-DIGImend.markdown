So, the old [DIGImend](http://digimend.github.io) is dead. I'm no longer going
to be doing much volunteer work on it, and although there were several people
approaching me with the interest of taking over, nobody has really stepped up
yet.

I thought about this situation for a while, feeling sad about all the unused
skills I acquired through these years working on the project, and pondered my
motivation. I couldn't arrive at a solution. Then I got contacted by [Neoblast
Inc.](http://neoblast.co.jp/) and [XP-Pen](http://xp-pen.com/), saying they
were alarmed by DIGImend shutting down and offering their financial support.
Neoblast Inc. is a Japanese company building affordable creativity-oriented
computers for moms and school PTAs, which run Linux and employ affordable
graphics tablets. XP-Pen is one of graphics tablet makers, which Neoblast Inc.
chose as a partner.

I secured a permission to do paid work in my free time from my employer, and
after a while we worked out the financing terms. They sent me three tablets to
make drivers for, and I started working. The work done so far, implementing
support for two tablets, was streamed to YouTube:

That and seeing creative people on YouTube get funded through Patreon brought
me into thinking that I can get some funding too, rationalize such work to
myself and my family, get motivation, and perhaps even get funded enough to
take some time off work for DIGImend.

Then I got contacted by [Ã–AMTC](https://www.oeamtc.at/) - apparently a car
owner's club or association (sorry, I don't know German), working on a project
using a signature pad. They wanted Linux drivers. I agreed and made the first
version of the driver:

At the same time, people started asking for drivers for the refreshed Huion
tablets. Apparently Huion switched to new hardware utilizing somewhat
different initialization and report protocols, incompatible with the old ones,
and they don't work on Linux. Some people offered to buy me a beer or send
donations. This sealed my resolve and I finally brought my self up to setup
[my own Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/spbnick). I'm still working out
rewards and goals, but this should be good for the start. I'll be glad to hear
your comments and advice about it!

I hope, of course, to get enough funding to get some time off work and
dedicate it to DIGImend eventually, but before that happens I'll do the work
proportional to the pledges I get, and do work on request from companies, in
my free time. I'll be contacting tablet manufacturers, again, to try to
interest them in funding my work.

So, if you need driver for your tablet, or would just like to see more
affordable tablets supported by Linux, consider pledging your support here:

If you're a company and would like specific drivers done for you, a part of
the Linux input stack improved, or bugs fixed, write to
