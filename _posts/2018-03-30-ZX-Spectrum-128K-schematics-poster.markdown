I'm trying to make a ZX Spectrum interface board as an exercise in electronics
and embedded programming, and need my Spectrum's schematics. Found one made by
Ian Worsley, and thought why not make a poster, while I'm at it. So, here you
go: Ian's schematics cleaned up, rearranged and combined into one sheet.

It's not the prettiest thing possible, and I haven't really verified if it's
entirely correct, but it's something I'll be able to refer to while working,
and enjoy the view of, on my wall.
