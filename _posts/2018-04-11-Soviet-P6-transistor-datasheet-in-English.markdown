About a year ago I watched a [Fran Blanche][fran_blanche_channel]'s
[video][sputnik_video] where she recreated a demonstration model of Soviet
Sputnik from 1957. The model's schematic was using (naturally) Soviet
[transistor П6Г][transistor_description_ru] (P6G). She didn't have that
transistor and wasn't sure about its parameters, so I left a comment linking
to its [datasheet in Russian][datasheet_ru] at the wonderful [Музей
Электронных Раритетов][museum] (Museum of Electronic Rarities], and offering
to translate it if anybody would be interested. A couple weeks ago a person
wrote asking for the translation, so I did it, and [here][datasheet_en] it is
for use of whoever wants to build the circuit with something closer to the
original transistor:

[![Datasheet thumbnail][datasheet_en_thumbnail]][datasheet_en]

You're not likely to find this transistor anywhere now, but if you want to get
close, apparently (according to the person who requested the translation) the
Soviet МП40А (MP40A) would do, and those are quite easy to buy on EBay.

I'm not fluent in transistors and their parameters, so some parts of the
translation might be awkward. If so, don't hesitate to leave a comment below
and I'll fix it!
