My name is Nikolai "spbnick" Kondrashov and I'm a self-taught software
engineer living in Espoo, Finland, formerly Saint-Petersburg, Russia.

I'm interested in all things computer software and hardware, preferring Open
Source flavors. This is a blog where I'm posting my findings in these and
other tech areas, which won't fit into a [Google Plus][1] post.
